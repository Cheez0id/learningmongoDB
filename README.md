# learningmongoDB
A repo to play around with mongo/mongoDB

1. Installed Mongo using https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb
    - this also installed compass, but I installed it previously not realizing that I needed to install mongo PATH
2. Reviewing youtube tutorial to get started
    - reviewing structure/syntax of **JSON** object.
    - briefly used mongoDB Compass UI to create *documents* / **REVIEW verbage: documents and collections**
3. Reviewing mongo shell commands
